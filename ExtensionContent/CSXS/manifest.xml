7. Term & Termination.
(a) Term. This Agreement will continue until terminated as set forth in this section. Recipient may 
terminate this Agreement at any time. Provider may terminate this Agreement immediately if 
Recipient violates any provision of this agreement or if Provider determines that the Software or 
any use thereof may result in infringement or violation of third party rights or claims thereof. Any

and 3(d) and Section 6 of this Agreement; and (ii) any other provision of this Agreement that must 
survive termination to fulfill its essential purpose.
8. Miscellaneous.
(a) Independent Contractors. The parties are independent contractors and will so represent 
themselves in all regards. Neither party is the agent of the other and neither may bind the other in 
any way.
(b) No Waiver. Neither party will be deemed to have waived any of its rights under this Agreement by 
lapse of time or by any statement or representation other than (i) by an Authorized 
Representative and (ii) in an explicit written waiver. No waiver of a breach of this Agreement will 
constitute a waiver of any prior or subsequent breach of this Agreement.
(c) Force Majeure. To the extent caused by force majeure, no delay, failure, or default will constitute 
a breach of this Agreement. 
(d) Assignment & Successors. Neither party may assign this Agreement or any of its rights or 
obligations hereunder without the other’s express written consent, except that Provider may 
assign this Agreement to the surviving party in a merger into another entity. Except to the extent 
forbidden in the previous sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of 
the respective successors and assigns of the parties.
(e) Choice of Law & Jurisdiction. This Agreement will be governed solely by the internal laws of the 
State of Massachusetts, without reference to such State’s principles of conflicts of law. The 
parties consent to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the federal and state courts of 
Boston, Massachusetts.
(f) Severability. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the parties hereby waive any provision of 
law that would render any clause of this Agreement invalid or otherwise unenforceable in any 
respect. In the event that a provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or otherwise 
unenforceable, such provision will be interpreted to fulfill its intended purpose to the maximum 
extent permitted by applicable law, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement will continue 
in full force and effect.
(g) Bankruptcy Rights. The rights and licenses granted to Recipient in Section 1 of this Agreement 
are licenses to “intellectual property” rights, as defined in Section 365(n) of the United States 
Bankruptcy Code (11 U.S.C. Section 101, et seq.). If Provider is subject to any proceeding under 
the United States Bankruptcy Code, and Provider as debtor in possession or its trustee in 4
bankruptcy elects to reject this Agreement, Recipient may, pursuant to 11 U.S.C. Section 
365(n)(1) and (2), retain any and all of the rights granted to it under Sections 1 of this Agreement 
to the maximum extent permitted by law. This Subsection 8(g) will not be construed to limit or 
restrict any right or remedy not set forth in this Subsection 8(g), including without limitation the 
right to retain any license or authority this Agreement grants pursuant to any provision other than 
Section 1.
(h) Conflicts among Attachments. In the event of any conflict between the terms of this main body of 
this Agreement and those of any attachment, the terms of this main body will govern.
(i) Entire Agreement. This Agreement sets forth the entire agreement of the parties and supersedes 
all prior or contemporaneous writings, negotiations, and discussions with respect to the subject 
matter hereof. Neither party has relied upon any such prior or contemporaneous communications.

each party and (ii) in a written contract signed by both parties.]]>
